# Mordle
Mordle is a sparse Wordle-like game, implemented in Python for the desktop using PyGame. Unlike Wordle, Mordle allows the user to play multiple games a day, offering the chance to quickly improve at starting word selection and guess-making. Other than this key difference, functionality is virtually the same and will be familiar to any Wordle players.
